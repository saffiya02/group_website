      <h2>Our History</h2>
      <p>The National Art Gallery of Malaysia, or Balai Seni Negara, was launched in 1958 and is among the earliest public art institutions in Southeast Asia. The idea of a national gallery was initiated by Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra Al-Haj, Malaysia's first Prime Minister, who recognized the need to protect and nurture the country's fledgling art following independence.

The gallery began with a modest number of artworks and was temporarily housed at Dewan Tunku Abdul Rahman. Over time, it expanded in size and scope and was eventually moved to its current permanent location on Jalan Tun Razak, Kuala Lumpur. Now, Balai Seni Negara is the country's main repository of modern and contemporary Malaysian art, with over 4,000 works in its permanent collection. It features a broad range of artistic genres such as painting, sculpture, installation, photography, and electronic media — and actively organizes exhibitions, workshops, artist residencies, and education programs with the aim of developing local talent and reaching out to the public.By its mission to document, preserve, and celebrate Malaysia's artistic heritage diversity, the National Art Gallery plays a pivotal role in shaping the cultural identity of the country both regionally and globally.</p>
